Jason Gillman Jr.'s Pigments Patches
====================================

Here's a collection of some patches I've made for Arturia's Pigments, but you probably knew that if you're here.

Sharing patches by way of git is, well, probably not supported by Arturia, but was just an experiment on my part.

Anyway, here are the steps for windows if you want to pull these in (can probably adjust for Mac, but I don't know):

1. cd to `C:\ProgramData\Arturia\Presets\Pigments\User`
1. git clone
1. Rename the repo's directory to `Jason Gillman Jr`

If you don't rename the directory, things should still work fine - despite the bank name being in the patch file themselves, it appears that Pigments will automatically update the files to reflect the name of the folder and use that as the bank name.
